# Fake-news-detection-model
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on Fake News Detection using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and logistic regression. The project utilizes Python and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and Scikit-learn to develop a reliable model for classifying news articles as fake or real.

Project Overview:
Fake news is a pressing issue in the modern digital age, and being able to automatically distinguish between fake and real news articles is of paramount importance. This project aims to address this challenge by creating an effective machine learning model that identifies fake news with high accuracy.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: Employed natural language processing techniques to clean and prepare the textual data for further analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
Logistic Regression: Chose logistic regression as the classification algorithm to predict whether a news article is fake or real.
Train-Test Split Methodology: Evaluated the model's performance using the train-test split methodology, ensuring reliable testing results.
Exceptional Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 98.24% on the testing dataset and 97.48% on the training dataset using logistic regression.

Results:
The model's exceptional accuracy demonstrates its effectiveness in distinguishing between fake and real news articles. The combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and logistic regression has proven to be a successful approach for fake news detection.
